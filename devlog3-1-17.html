//Side note; I (160253C) didn't have time to get any of the calibration checked for today, more than likely we will have to get it done this Friday.
+ Completed textures for pods 3 and 4
+ Updated VAL interface textures
+ Updated VAL interface model
- Removed "Retro Theme" (more than likely we will bring it back... again)
- Script version 9 now revised
- Recorded draft dialogue for VAL, s1-e1 (dialogue not final!)
    > This is the first dialogue recorded and tested
    //131270 said that the dialugue we used to test eariler didn't work, hopefully this set works out better.
- Fixed the random freezing that happened when VAL and videos showed up on the screen
- Meal slot didn't actually open, fixed that
- General bug fixes

To-Do before ALPHA BUILD:
- Complete the first draft textures for all pods
- Complete the latest draft of the script
- Send latest draft to A. G.
- Continue improving the art and design of the pods
- Continue improving and updating the art and design of VAL's hub
- Randomly choose what pod the 'guest' will be in
- Current Tests designed: 15, Goal: 100-150
- Current Treatments designed: 6, Goal: 35-75
  //If we get the budget and time, we will stretch the goal to 200+ Tests and 100+ Treatments
  //These would all be randomly selected from so each time the 'Guest' starts, it will be a fresh experience
- Consider and consult the possibility of other VR platforms (Oculus, PSVR, etc.)
- Calibrate the controls and the accuracy while in VR
- Continue to fix and stomp bugs

//160253C Final notes for the day; tommorow's focus:
  - email out the final version of draft 9
  - if the script is good, finalize and make the minor revisions. Use it to record s1-e2through4
  - Design at least 3 tests per team member available tomorrow
  - Design at least 2 treatments tomorrow
  + Bonus, work on pod modeling and texturing
